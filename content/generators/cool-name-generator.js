    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate cool names for specific purposes (e.g., gaming, characters, brands)?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! The more specific your input (e.g., 'cool gamer tag for FPS', 'cool name for a fantasy assassin', 'cool tech brand name'), the more tailored and relevant the suggestions will be."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the generator determine what makes a name 'cool'?",
      answer: "The AI identifies patterns in names that are generally perceived as cool across different contexts, often involving phonetic appeal, associations with positive traits (strength, mystery, style), and modern linguistic trends. It aims for names that sound impactful and distinctive."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the names guaranteed to be unique or available?",
      answer: "The generator provides creative ideas, but it does not check for real-time availability (e.g., for online usernames, domain names, or business registrations). You will need to manually check availability for commercial or online use."
    },

      question: "Should a cool name be short or long?",
      answer: "Often, shorter and more concise names have a punchier, cooler feel. However, a longer name can be cool if it's exceptionally descriptive or evocative and easy to remember. Focus on impact and memorability over strict length."
