    <h3>The Imperative of a Strong Password</h3>
    <p>A secure password:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prevents Unauthorized Access:</strong> Stops hackers and malicious actors from logging into your accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Protects Personal Data:</strong> Safeguards sensitive information like financials, emails, and private messages.</li>
      <li><strong>Mitigates Breach Impact:</strong> If one account is compromised, unique passwords prevent a domino effect.</li>
      <li><strong>Resists Brute-Force Attacks:</strong> Complex passwords are nearly impossible for automated tools to guess.</li>
      <li><strong>Ensures Privacy:</strong> Keeps your online activities and communications private.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our generator uses cryptographic randomness to produce passwords that are highly resistant to common hacking techniques, ensuring your digital security.</p>

    <h3>How Our Generator Forges Digital Fortresses</h3>
    <p>Using our Secure Password Generator is straightforward and critical:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Choose Length:</strong> Select the desired length for your password (e.g., 12, 16, 20+ characters; longer is always better).</li>
      <li><strong>Select Character Types:</strong> Choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Using a mix is highly recommended for maximum security.</li>

      <li><strong>Copy & Use Securely:</strong> Copy the generated password and paste it directly into your account registration or login fields. **Never write it down in an unsecure location.** Consider using a reputable password manager.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This tool empowers you to practice excellent cyber hygiene effortlessly, providing peace of mind in an increasingly connected world.</p>

    <h3>Tips for Unbreakable Password Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use a Password Manager:</strong> This is the safest way to store and manage complex, unique passwords for all your accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Add an extra layer of security requiring a second verification step (e.g., a code from your phone).</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Reusing Passwords:</strong> Each online account should have a unique password.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't Share Passwords:</strong> Keep your passwords private.</li>
      <li><strong>Update Regularly (Optional):</strong> While unique and complex passwords reduce the need for frequent changes, updating critical account passwords annually can add an extra layer of caution.</li>
      <li><strong>Beware of Phishing:</strong> Always double-check website URLs before entering credentials.</li>

    {
      question: "What makes a password 'secure'?",
      answer: "A secure password is long (12+ characters), random, and combines a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It avoids common words, personal information, and predictable patterns."
    },
    {
      question: "Why should I use symbols and numbers?",
      answer: "Including symbols and numbers significantly increases the complexity and character space of your password, making it much harder for hackers using brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks to guess."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe to generate passwords online?",
      answer: "Yes, our generator creates passwords locally in your browser. The generated passwords are not transmitted to our servers or stored anywhere, ensuring your privacy. However, it's crucial how you handle the password *after* it's generated (e.g., using a password manager)."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I memorize my generated passwords?",
      answer: "It's nearly impossible to memorize truly random, complex passwords. This is why password managers are highly recommended. They securely store your passwords, so you only need to remember one master password."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I change my passwords?",
      answer: "For unique, complex passwords, frequent changes are less critical than in the past. Focus on using unique passwords for every site and enabling 2FA. Change immediately if a service announces a data breach or if you suspect compromise."
