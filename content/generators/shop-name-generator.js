    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate names for online shops and physical stores?",
      answer: "Yes, our generator is versatile and can provide names suitable for both e-commerce businesses and traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Just include relevant keywords like 'online boutique' or 'local craft store'."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I check if a generated shop name is available?",
      answer: "After generating names, you should check for availability as a business name registration with your local government, a domain name (e.g., .com, .store), and across major social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc.)."

    },

      answer: "Absolutely! Provide keywords related to your niche (e.g., 'vintage fashion boutique', 'cozy bookstore', 'artisanal jewelry shop') in the input field to receive more tailored and relevant name suggestions."
