      answer: "The generator creates a wide range of names, including creative, descriptive, professional, catchy, and unique options, tailored to the keywords and purpose you provide. You can specify a type like 'blog name ideas' or 'e-commerce website names'."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate names for specific types of websites (e.g., blogs, e-commerce, portfolios)?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! The more specific your input (e.g., 'name for a cooking blog', 'e-commerce site for handmade goods', 'photography portfolio name'), the more relevant the suggestions will be."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I check if a domain name is available?",
      answer: "Once you generate a few favorite names, you'll need to use a domain registrar's search tool (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains) to check if the corresponding .com or other preferred extension is available for registration."
    },
    {
      question: "Should my website name include keywords for SEO?",
      answer: "While including keywords can be beneficial for SEO, the most important thing is that your website name is brandable, memorable, and easy to say and type. Find a balance between keywords and brand appeal."
    },
    {
      question: "What if all the good names are already taken?",
      answer: "Don't despair! Try adding prefixes/suffixes (e.g., 'The', 'My', 'Hub', 'Pro'), combining words, using synonyms, or exploring different domain extensions (.co, .io, .shop, .blog) if .com isn't available and you're set on a specific name."
