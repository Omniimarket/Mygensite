      question: "What's the difference between a slogan and a catchphrase?",
      answer: "While often similar, a slogan is typically a marketing tagline for a product or company (e.g., 'Just Do It'), whereas a catchphrase is a distinctive phrase associated with a person, character, or idea, often used repeatedly (e.g., 'To infinity and beyond!')."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate catchphrases for specific characters or scenarios?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! The more context you provide in your input prompt, the better the AI can tailor the catchphrases. For example, 'catchphrase for a quirky wizard' or 'catchphrase for a motivational speaker'."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should a good catchphrase be?",
      answer: "Generally, the shorter and snappier, the better for memorability. Most effective catchphrases are between 2 to 7 words, but the key is impact and clarity over strict length."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the generated content unique and copyright-free?",
      answer: "The AI generates unique combinations of words. While the output is original, it's always recommended to perform your own trademark and copyright searches, especially if you plan to use the catchphrase commercially."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate catchphrases for personal use, like a personal motto?",
      answer: "Yes, definitely! It's a great tool for finding a personal motto, a funny saying for a t-shirt, or a signature line for your online profile. Just describe the feeling or idea you want to convey."
