      question: "What kind of album names does it generate?",
      answer: "The generator creates a wide range of names, from single-word evocative titles to more conceptual phrases, drawing inspiration from various genres and themes based on your input. You can specify genre (e.g., 'metal album names', 'indie folk album names') for more tailored results."
    },
    {
      question: "How detailed should my input be?",
      answer: "The more descriptive your keywords or themes are, the better the AI can understand your artistic vision. Include genre, mood, lyrical concepts, or even specific imagery you associate with your music."
    },
    {
      question: "Can it suggest names for specific genres (e.g., electronic, classical)?",
      answer: "Yes, by including the genre in your prompt (e.g., 'album name for experimental electronic music', 'title for a classical piano album'), the AI will try to align suggestions with that style."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I get names that are already taken?",
      answer: "The AI generates original combinations, but it doesn't check for existing titles. Always perform your own research (e.g., on streaming platforms, music databases) to ensure your chosen name is unique before finalizing it."
    },
    {
      question: "Should an album name be mysterious or direct?",
      answer: "It depends on your artistic intent! Mysterious names can invite curiosity, while direct names clearly state the album's theme. Our generator can provide options for both approaches based on your prompt."
