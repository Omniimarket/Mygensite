    <ol>
      <li><strong>Enter Your Topic/Idea:</strong> Type in keywords or a brief concept for your tweet (e.g., "tech news update", "personal thought on productivity", "question about remote work", "promote new blog post").</li>
      <li><strong>Specify Tone/Purpose (Optional):</strong> Add preferences like "witty", "informative", "controversial", "inspirational", "humorous", or "call to action" to guide the AI's style.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate Tweets:</strong> Click the "Generate" button, and the AI will present a list of diverse and concise tweet suggestions, often including relevant hashtags and emojis.</li>

    <h3>Tips for Maximizing Tweet Engagement</h3>
    <p>Even with AI assistance, these best practices will help your tweets soar:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Character Count:</strong> Aim for under 280 characters (including spaces, links, and hashtags). Shorter tweets often get more engagement.</li>
      <li><strong>Strong Opening:</strong> The first few words are crucial. Make them attention-grabbing.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Encourage replies and interaction by posing direct questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Hashtags Wisely:</strong> Use 1-2 highly relevant hashtags per tweet. Too many can look spammy.</li>
      <li><strong>Include Media:</strong> Tweets with images, GIFs, or videos often perform better.</li>
      <li><strong>Call to Action:</strong> Clearly tell your audience what you want them to do (e.g., "RT if you agree!", "Click the link for more info").</li>
      <li><strong>Engage with Trends:</strong> Use trending topics or hashtags if relevant to your message.</li>
      <li><strong>Timeliness:</strong> Post when your audience is most active for maximum visibility.</li>
    </ul>
