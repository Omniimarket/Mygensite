      <li><strong>Address the Hiring Manager:</strong> Whenever possible, find out the name of the hiring manager and address them directly.</li>
      <li><strong>Highlight Achievements, Not Just Duties:</strong> Instead of listing job duties, describe what you *achieved* in your previous roles, quantified with numbers where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Show, Don't Tell:</strong> Instead of saying you're "a good problem-solver," give an example of a problem you solved.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep it Concise:</strong> Aim for one page, ideally 3-4 paragraphs. Respect the recruiter's time.</li>
      <li><strong>Proofread Meticulously:</strong> Typos and grammatical errors can quickly disqualify an application. Use spell-checkers and have someone else review it.</li>
      <li><strong>Match Keywords:</strong> Incorporate relevant keywords from the job description naturally throughout your letter.</li>
    </ul>
