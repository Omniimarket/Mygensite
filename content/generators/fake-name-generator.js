    {
      question: "What kind of fake names does it generate?",
      answer: "The generator creates realistic-sounding names (first and last) and can optionally provide associated details like addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. You can often specify gender, nationality, or ethnic origin in your prompt."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the generated names, addresses, or emails real?",
      answer: "No, the generated names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses are entirely fictitious. They are algorithmically created to appear realistic but do not correspond to any real individuals or active accounts. This is for privacy and ethical use in creative or testing contexts."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I specify the nationality or gender of the fake name?",
      answer: "Yes, you can include preferences in your prompt, such as 'Japanese female name', 'British male name', or 'random American identity'. The AI will tailor the output accordingly."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe to use these fake details for online accounts?",
      answer: "These details are intended for use in contexts where anonymity or dummy data is required (e.g., testing forms, game character creation, creative writing). You should NEVER use these fake details for real-world financial, legal, or sensitive online accounts, as it could have serious consequences."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a 'random name' generator and a 'fake name' generator?",
      answer: "A 'random name' generator typically just provides first and last names. A 'fake name' generator often provides more comprehensive fictitious details, simulating a full identity with addresses, phone numbers, and other data points, designed for more robust testing or creative scenarios."
