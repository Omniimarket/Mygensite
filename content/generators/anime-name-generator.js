    {
      question: "What's the difference between given names and surnames in anime?",
      answer: "In Japanese culture (often reflected in anime), the surname (family name) comes before the given name. Many anime names are chosen for their sound, meaning, or connection to character traits, sometimes diverging from real-world common names for stylistic effect."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate names for characters of different origins (e.g., non-Japanese-inspired)?",
      answer: "While the generator has a strong foundation in Japanese-inspired anime names, you can input keywords for other origins (e.g., 'European fantasy knight', 'futuristic space pilot') to get names that blend different styles, if that fits your anime's world."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it okay to use names that sound similar to existing anime characters?",
      answer: "It's generally best to aim for originality to avoid confusion and copyright issues. However, drawing inspiration from the *style* of names within the genre is common and encouraged."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate names for non-human anime characters (e.g., spirits, monsters)?",
      answer: "Yes! By describing the non-human entity (e.g., 'forest spirit ancient', 'cybernetic monster', 'magical creature playful'), the generator can provide more fantastical or abstract names suitable for such characters."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I want a name with a specific meaning?",
      answer: "Try inputting keywords related to the meaning (e.g., 'fire', 'light', 'strong', 'wise') and the AI will try to generate names that embody those concepts, or give you names whose known meanings align."
