    },
    {
      question: "Does it provide full plots or just starting points?",
      answer: "The generator primarily provides strong conceptual starting points and compelling premises. You would then develop the full plot, character arcs, and world-building details yourself, using the idea as a springboard."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I include specific character types or settings?",
      answer: "Yes, feel free to include details about character archetypes (e.g., 'reluctant hero', 'wise mentor', 'cunning villain') or specific settings (e.g., 'medieval castle', 'futuristic city', 'desert island') to guide the ideas."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it suitable for short stories or novels?",
