      question: "What's the difference between a roast and an insult?",
      answer: "The key difference is intent and context. A roast is a humorous, good-natured teasing performed among friends or for entertainment, where the 'victim' is in on the joke. An insult is intended to genuinely hurt or demean someone."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I ensure the roast is funny and not offensive?",
      answer: "The most important rule is to know your audience and the person being roasted. Stick to lighthearted observations about their quirks, hobbies, or minor habits. Avoid anything personal, sensitive, or mean-spirited. When in doubt, err on the side of caution."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this for public speaking or formal events?",
      answer: "This tool can provide great ideas, but for formal events or public speaking, always heavily review and refine the content to ensure it aligns with the event's tone and audience. Test jokes with trusted friends beforehand."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the generated roasts aren't personalized enough?",
      answer: "Try providing more specific (but still light-hearted) details in your input about the person's unique habits, hobbies, or well-known traits. The more specific, the more tailored the roast can be."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I warn someone they're going to be roasted?",
      answer: "Yes, it's generally a good idea, especially if they're not accustomed to this type of humor. Ensuring they're aware it's all in good fun helps set the right tone and prevents discomfort."
