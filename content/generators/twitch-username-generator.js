      question: "What kind of Twitch usernames does it generate?",
      answer: "The generator creates a wide range of usernames, including gamer-focused, creative, funny, aesthetic, and niche-specific names, all based on the keywords and style preferences you provide."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate usernames for specific games or streaming content?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! The more specific your input (e.g., 'username for Valorant streamer', 'Twitch name for ASMR content', 'creative stream name for art'), the more tailored and relevant the suggestions will be."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I check if a Twitch username is available?",
      answer: "After generating names, you'll need to go to Twitch (either during signup or in your settings) and try to change or register the username. Twitch will tell you if it's available or taken."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best length for a Twitch username?",
      answer: "Twitch usernames can be between 4 and 25 characters. While you have flexibility, shorter, punchier names (ideally under 15 characters) are often more memorable and easier for viewers to type in chat."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I include numbers or special characters if my desired name is taken?",
      answer: "If your ideal name is taken, adding subtle numbers (e.g., 'GamerGirl92') or underscores (e.g., 'Elite_Streamer') can help secure a unique version. Avoid overly complex combinations that are hard to remember."
