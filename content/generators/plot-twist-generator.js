    {
      question: "What kind of plot twists can the generator create?",
      answer: "The generator can suggest various types of twists, including identity revelations, betrayals, hidden motives, surprising origins, 'it was all a dream/simulation' scenarios, unexpected reversals of fortune, and more, based on the context you provide."
    },
    {
      question: "How detailed should my story description be?",
      answer: "The more context you give (genre, main characters, current conflict, desired emotional impact), the more tailored the plot twist suggestions will be. A paragraph or a few key sentences is usually sufficient."
    },
    {
      question: "Can it suggest twists for different genres (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, thriller)?",
      answer: "Yes! By including your genre in the prompt (e.g., 'plot twist for a fantasy epic', 'psychological thriller twist'), the AI will try to generate ideas that fit the conventions and expectations of that specific genre."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I make a twist feel earned, not just random?",
      answer: "The key is foreshadowing. Once you pick a twist, go back through your story and weave in subtle clues, misdirections, or seemingly insignificant details that, in retrospect, point towards the twist. This makes it surprising but logical."
    },
    {
      question: "Should every story have a plot twist?",
      answer: "No, not every story needs a plot twist. A twist should only be included if it genuinely enhances the narrative, deepens character development, or strengthens the story's themes. A forced twist can detract from your story."
