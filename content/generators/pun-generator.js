      question: "What kind of puns does it generate?",
      answer: "The generator creates various types of puns, including homophonic puns (words that sound alike), homographic puns (words spelled alike but with different meanings), and semantic puns (playing on double meanings). The type generated depends on your input and the AI's linguistic understanding."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get puns for specific topics or situations?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! The more specific your input (e.g., 'puns about plants', 'food puns for a restaurant', 'puns for a dull meeting'), the more tailored the suggestions will be."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the puns aren't very good?",
      answer: "Puns are subjective! If you don't like the initial suggestions, try rephrasing your input or using a different keyword. Sometimes, slightly altering the context can lead to more creative results. Remember, even a 'bad' pun can be good for a laugh!"
    },
    {
      question: "Are puns suitable for all audiences?",
      answer: "Puns can be enjoyed by many, but their effectiveness depends on the audience's sense of humor and understanding of the wordplay. Always consider who you're speaking to when using puns."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a pun and a joke?",
      answer: "A pun is a form of wordplay that exploits multiple meanings of a word, or similar-sounding words, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect. A joke is a broader term for something said or done to evoke humor, which may or may not involve wordplay."
