      question: "What kind of bios can the generator create?",
      answer: "The generator can create professional bios (for LinkedIn, websites, speaking engagements) and personal bios (for social media, personal blogs), adapting to the tone and content you specify in your prompt."
    },
    {
      question: "Should a bio be written in first person or third person?",
      answer: "For professional contexts (like a company website or speaking engagement), the third person ('John Doe is a...') is common. For social media profiles or personal blogs, the first person ('I am a...') can feel more authentic. Our generator can provide drafts in either, depending on your prompt."
    },
    {
      question: "How detailed should my input be for the best results?",
      answer: "The more specific details you provide about your role, industry, key skills, major accomplishments (especially with numbers or quantifiable results), and aspirations, the more tailored and effective the generated bio will be."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should a good bio be?",
