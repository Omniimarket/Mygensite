    {
      question: "What elements make a good superhero name?",
      answer: "A good superhero name often incorporates elements of their powers (e.g., 'Electro', 'Iceman'), their origin (e.g., 'Captain Britain', 'Black Panther'), or a key characteristic (e.g., 'The Hulk', 'Doctor Strange'). It should be memorable and impactful."
    },
    {
      question: "Should a superhero name be one word or a phrase?",
      answer: "Both work! Many iconic heroes have one-word names (e.g., 'Superman', 'Batman'), while others have phrases (e.g., 'Captain America', 'Green Lantern'). The key is memorability and how well it fits the character."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I make sure the name isn't already taken?",
      answer: "While this generator provides unique combinations, for serious creative projects (like publishing), you should always conduct thorough searches across comic databases, trademark registries, and general web searches to ensure originality."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate names for a team of superheroes?",
      answer: "While designed for individual heroes, you can use the generator for each team member, or use keywords related to the team's collective powers or mission (e.g., 'justice defenders', 'cosmic guardians') to get team name ideas."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I want a more unique or abstract name?",
      answer: "Try using more abstract keywords or concepts (e.g., 'vortex', 'aether', 'quantum', 'cipher') or combine seemingly unrelated words. You can also play with prefixes and suffixes (e.g., 'Aero-', '-X', 'Omni-')."
