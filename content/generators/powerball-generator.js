    <h3>How Our Powerball Generator Works</h3>
    <p>Our <strong>Powerball Number Generator</strong> uses a secure and fair random number generation algorithm to produce your lucky picks. The process is simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Random Selection (White Balls):</strong> It randomly selects five unique numbers from 1 to 69.</li>
      <li><strong>Random Selection (Red Powerball):</strong> It then randomly selects one number from 1 to 26 for the Powerball.</li>
      <li><strong>Guaranteed Format:</strong> The output always matches the required Powerball format (5 white numbers + 1 red Powerball).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each time you click 'Generate', you'll get a brand new, completely random set of numbers.</p>

    </ol>
