    {
      question: "How does the Fortnite Name Generator work?",
      answer: "You enter keywords related to your gaming style, favorite characters, or any other ideas you have. Our AI then processes these inputs and generates a list of unique, creative, and game-appropriate names by combining your keywords with popular gaming terms, cultural references, and common naming conventions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use special characters or numbers in the generated names?",
      answer: "While Fortnite allows certain special characters and numbers, our generator primarily focuses on generating creative word-based names. You can manually add numbers or simple underscores to the generated suggestions to check for availability or further personalize them."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the names guaranteed to be available in Fortnite?",
      answer: "No, the generator provides name ideas, but it cannot guarantee availability on Epic Games' servers. Player names are unique, and many names may already be taken. We recommend trying several variations or adding numbers/special characters if your desired name is unavailable."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of keywords should I use for better results?",
      answer: "Think about your playstyle (e.g., 'builder', 'sniper', 'rusher'), your favorite Fortnite skins or locations, your personality (e.g., 'stealthy', 'fiery', 'chill'), or even real-world hobbies or interests. The more descriptive your keywords, the more tailored the suggestions will be."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate names for my squad or team?",
      answer: "Absolutely! While designed for individual names, you can input themes or inside jokes related to your squad, and the generator can provide ideas that might work well for a collective team name, or individual names with a common style."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this generator only for Fortnite Battle Royale?",
      answer: "While optimized for Battle Royale, the names generated can also be suitable for Fortnite Creative, Save the World, or any other gaming platform where you want a unique gamer tag."
