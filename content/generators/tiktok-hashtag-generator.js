      question: "How does the generator find relevant TikTok hashtags?",
      answer: "Our AI analyzes current TikTok trends, popular content categories, and user behavior patterns. When you input your video's topic, it identifies a mix of high-volume, trending, and niche-specific hashtags that are likely to boost your content's discoverability."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I use only trending hashtags?",
      answer: "No, a balanced approach is best. While trending hashtags offer broad reach, niche-specific hashtags (e.g., #booktok, #gamingsetup) help you connect with highly engaged communities. Our generator provides both."
    },
    {
      question: "How many hashtags should I use per TikTok video?",
      answer: "TikTok allows up to 100 characters in the caption, including hashtags. While there's no strict rule, 3-5 highly relevant hashtags often perform well. Focus on quality and relevance over quantity."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate hashtags for a specific niche or community?",
      answer: "Yes! Be as specific as possible in your input. For example, instead of 'art', try 'watercolor painting tutorial' or 'digital art process' to get more targeted suggestions."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this tool suitable for both personal and business TikTok accounts?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Whether you're an individual creator, a small business, or a large brand, strategic hashtagging is vital. Our generator adapts to your input, helping both personal and business accounts find relevant tags for their content goals."
