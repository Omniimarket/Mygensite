      question: "Can I generate names for any RPG genre?",

    },
    {
      question: "How do I make names sound specific to a fantasy race (e.g., Orc, Elf, Dwarf)?",
      answer: "Include the race in your input (e.g., 'Elven warrior', 'Orc chieftain', 'Dwarven smith'). The AI has knowledge of common fantasy naming conventions and will adapt its suggestions accordingly."
    },

      question: "Is this tool useful for naming magic spells or items?",
