    {
      question: "What's the difference between a company slogan and a mission statement?",
      answer: "A mission statement is a longer, more detailed explanation of a company's purpose and goals. A company slogan (or tagline) is a short, memorable phrase designed for external marketing, summarizing the brand's essence."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate slogans for specific industries or types of businesses?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! The more context you provide about your industry (e.g., 'slogan for a tech startup', 'slogan for a non-profit organization', 'slogan for a local bakery'), the more tailored the suggestions will be."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should a good company slogan be?",
      answer: "Generally, shorter is better for memorability. Most effective company slogans are between 3 to 7 words, but the key is impact and clarity over strict length."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the generated content unique and copyright-free?",
      answer: "The AI generates unique combinations of words. While the output is original, it's always recommended to perform your own trademark and copyright searches before finalizing and legally registering any slogan for commercial use."
    },
    {
      question: "Should a slogan focus on the product or the customer benefit?",
      answer: "Often, focusing on the customer benefit is more powerful. Instead of 'We make great shoes,' consider 'Walk with comfort and style.' Our generator can help you explore both approaches based on your input."
