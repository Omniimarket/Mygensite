      <li><strong>Factor in Travel Time:</strong> Always overestimate travel time between locations to avoid feeling rushed or missing connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Pack Smart:</strong> Research the weather and local customs. Pack versatile clothing and essentials, but leave room for souvenirs!</li>
      <li><strong>Learn Basic Phrases:</strong> Even a few words in the local language (hello, thank you, please) can greatly enhance your experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Inform Your Bank & Family:</strong> Notify your bank of your travel dates to avoid card issues. Share your itinerary with trusted contacts.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay Hydrated & Rested:</strong> Travel can be tiring. Drink plenty of water and ensure you get enough sleep to enjoy each day.</li>
      <li><strong>Backup Important Documents:</strong> Keep digital copies of your passport, visa, tickets, and bookings in the cloud and on your phone.</li>
      <li><strong>Embrace the Unexpected:</strong> Some of the best travel memories come from unplanned moments or overcoming small challenges.</li>

  faq: [
    {
      question: "How does the AI create a personalized travel itinerary?",
      answer: "The AI takes into account your specified destination, travel dates, preferred activities (e.g., historical tours, outdoor adventures, culinary experiences), desired pace (relaxed, moderate, fast-paced), and any budget considerations. It then uses this information to suggest attractions, dining options, and logistical arrangements tailored to your interests."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate an itinerary for multiple destinations?",
      answer: "Currently, the generator is optimized for single-destination itineraries. However, you can input a multi-city prompt and the AI will do its best to interpret and create a sequential plan. For complex multi-country trips, you might consider generating separate itineraries for each major city or country and then linking them manually."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the generator book flights or accommodations?",
      answer: "No, the AI Travel Itinerary Generator creates a suggested plan of activities, transportation, and dining. It does not perform actual bookings for flights, hotels, or tours. It will provide recommendations and structure your days, but you will need to handle the booking process separately."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it possible to specify a budget for the itinerary?",
      answer: "Yes, you can include your budget (e.g., 'budget-friendly', 'mid-range', 'luxury') in your prompt. The AI will then try to recommend activities, dining, and transportation options that generally fall within that financial scope. Keep in mind that specific pricing will vary and should be verified independently."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get suggestions for family-friendly activities?",
      answer: "Absolutely! When describing your interests, include terms like 'family-friendly', 'kid-friendly', 'suitable for children', or specify the ages of travelers. The AI will prioritize attractions and activities that are generally suitable and enjoyable for families."
    },
    {
      question: "How detailed are the daily schedules?",
      answer: "The generated itineraries provide a structured daily breakdown, often dividing the day into morning, afternoon, and evening segments. For each segment, it suggests activities, potential dining options, and sometimes brief travel notes. The level of detail can sometimes depend on the specificity of your initial prompt."
