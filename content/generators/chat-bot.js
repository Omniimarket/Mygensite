    <p>To get the best results from our AI Chatbot, consider these interaction strategies:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Be Clear and Specific:</strong> The more precise your question or instruction, the better the AI can understand and respond.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Keywords:</strong> Include relevant keywords to help the AI narrow down its focus and retrieve accurate information.</li>
      <li><strong>Break Down Complex Requests:</strong> For multi-part tasks, break them into smaller, sequential prompts.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide Context:</strong> If your query relates to a previous turn, ensure you provide enough context for the AI to follow.</li>
      <li><strong>Experiment with Phrasing:</strong> If you don't get the desired result, try rephrasing your question or instruction differently.</li>
      <li><strong>Specify Output Needs:</strong> If you need a specific format (e.g., a list, a summary, a poem), mention it in your prompt.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide Examples:</strong> For creative tasks, giving a short example of the desired style or content can guide the AI.</li>

      question: "What can your AI Chatbot do?",
      answer: "Our AI Chatbot is a versatile tool that can answer questions on a wide range of topics, generate creative text (like stories, poems, code), summarize long documents, brainstorm ideas, translate languages, and engage in general conversation. Think of it as a helpful digital assistant."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the AI always accurate?",
      answer: "While our AI strives for accuracy and is trained on vast amounts of data, it can sometimes make mistakes or provide information that is not entirely current. It's always a good practice to verify critical information, especially for important decisions or factual accuracy."
    },
    {
      question: "Can the AI learn from my conversations?",
      answer: "The AI model itself is pre-trained and does not 'learn' in a persistent way from individual user conversations. Each interaction is treated as a new session. However, the developers continuously refine the underlying models based on broad usage patterns to improve its overall performance and accuracy over time."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my conversation private?",
      answer: "While we prioritize user privacy, please avoid sharing highly sensitive personal information. Conversations are processed by the AI for generating responses and may be used in an anonymized, aggregated form for model improvement. Always review our privacy policy for full details."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best way to ask a question?",
      answer: "Be clear, concise, and specific. If you're looking for factual information, state your question directly. If you're asking for creative content, provide as much context and as many requirements as possible (e.g., 'Write a short story about a brave knight, set in a magical forest, with a happy ending')."
    },
    {
      question: "Can the AI generate inappropriate content?",
      answer: "Our AI is designed with safeguards to prevent the generation of harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content. However, no system is perfect, and if you encounter any problematic responses, please provide feedback so we can continue to improve our moderation and safety features."
