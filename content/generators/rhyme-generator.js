    {
      question: "What kind of rhymes does it generate?",
      answer: "The generator primarily focuses on perfect rhymes (words with identical sounds from the vowel onwards) but can also suggest near rhymes or slant rhymes (words with similar but not identical sounds), depending on the input and linguistic patterns."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get rhymes for phrases or multiple words?",
      answer: "The generator works best with single words as input. For phrases, you might need to break them down into key words and find rhymes for each, then combine them creatively."
    },
    {
      question: "Does it provide definitions or context for the rhyming words?",
      answer: "No, the generator focuses solely on providing words that rhyme phonetically. You'll need to use your own knowledge or a dictionary to understand the meaning and context of the suggested words."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't like any of the generated rhymes?",
      answer: "If the initial suggestions don't fit, try inputting a synonym for your original word, or rephrasing the line you're trying to rhyme. Sometimes a slight change in the target word can open up many new rhyming possibilities."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a limit to how many rhymes I can generate?",
      answer: "No, you can generate an unlimited number of rhymes. Feel free to use the tool as much as you need for all your creative writing endeavors!"
