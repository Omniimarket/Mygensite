    <h3>Tips for Successful Cooking with Generated Recipes</h3>
    <p>While AI provides great ideas, these culinary best practices will ensure delicious results:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Read Through First:</strong> Before you start cooking, read the entire recipe to understand the steps and gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li><strong>Mise en Place:</strong> Prepare all your ingredients (chop vegetables, measure spices) before you begin cooking. This makes the process much smoother.</li>
      <li><strong>Trust Your Senses:</strong> Use your judgment for seasoning and cooking times. Taste as you go!</li>
      <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Ensure all ingredients, especially meats and poultry, are cooked to safe internal temperatures.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't Be Afraid to Adapt:</strong> Recipes are guides. If you don't have an ingredient, look for a suitable substitute, or if a step seems off, use your culinary common sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean As You Go:</strong> Tidying up during cooking makes the post-meal cleanup much easier.</li>
    </ul>
