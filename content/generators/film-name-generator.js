      question: "Can I generate names for specific film genres (e.g., documentary, sci-fi, drama)?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! The more specific your input (e.g., 'title for a historical documentary', 'sci-fi short film name', 'indie drama title'), the more tailored and relevant the suggestions will be."

    {
      question: "What's the ideal length for a film name?",
      answer: "While there's no strict rule, many impactful film titles are relatively short, often 1-3 words. Longer titles can work if they are particularly evocative or poetic, but generally, conciseness is key for marketability and memorability."

      question: "What's the difference between a 'film name' and a 'movie title'?",
