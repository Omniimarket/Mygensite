  faq: [
    {
      question: "How does the generator create truths and a lie?",
      answer: "The generator uses AI to craft three statements â€“ two plausible truths and one believable lie â€“ based on general knowledge or common human experiences. You can provide keywords in your prompt to guide the themes of these statements, for example, 'two truths and a lie about hobbies'."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the generated statements always applicable to me?",
      answer: "The statements are general suggestions. You'll need to review them and adapt them to your own experiences, or use them as inspiration to come up with your own personalized truths and lies. The idea is to give you a strong starting point."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get ideas for specific types of lies (e.g., funny, surprising)?",
      answer: "While not a direct feature, you can try to influence the AI's output by providing a prompt that includes descriptors like 'generate a funny two truths and a lie' or 'generate a surprising two truths and a lie'."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the lie is too obvious or too hard to guess?",
      answer: "The AI aims for a good balance, but if a statement isn't working for your group, simply generate a new set. The key is to find statements that are challenging but not impossible to differentiate."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best way to present the statements?",
      answer: "Read them confidently and with a neutral expression. Try not to give away any clues through your voice tone or body language. The more convincing you are, the more fun the game will be for everyone!"
    }
