    {
      question: "What's the primary difference between a tagline and a slogan?",
      answer: "A tagline is generally a more permanent and overarching statement that defines your entire brand (e.g., Nike: 'Just Do It'). A slogan is often campaign-specific and more temporary (e.g., a slogan for a new product launch)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate taglines for personal brands as well?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! Just describe your personal brand, skills, values, and career aspirations, and the AI will generate taglines suitable for your professional profile or personal website."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should a good tagline be?",
      answer: "Taglines are typically very concise, often between 3 to 7 words. The goal is maximum impact with minimum words, making it easy to remember and integrate into all branding materials."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the generated content unique and free to use?",
      answer: "The AI generates original combinations of words. While the output is new, it is always recommended to perform your own trademark and copyright searches to ensure your chosen tagline is legally available for commercial use."
    },
    {
      question: "Should a tagline focus on the product, the company, or the customer benefit?",
      answer: "Often, the most powerful taglines focus on the customer benefit or the emotional outcome. They articulate what the customer gains or how they feel by engaging with your brand, rather than just what the brand does. Our generator can help you explore all these angles."
