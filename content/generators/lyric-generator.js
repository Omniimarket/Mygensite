  faq: [
    {
      question: "What kind of lyrics does it generate?",
      answer: "The generator can create lyrical ideas for various genres (pop, rock, folk, hip-hop, country, etc.) and moods (love, sadness, joy, anger, rebellion). The output style and content are highly dependent on the themes and keywords you provide in your prompt."
    },
    {
      question: "How detailed should my input be for better results?",
      answer: "The more context you give (e.g., 'lyrics about overcoming adversity, hopeful tone, pop genre', 'rap lyrics about street life, gritty, narrative focus'), the more tailored and useful the lyrical suggestions will be."
    },
    {
      question: "Can it generate full songs or just snippets?",
      answer: "Currently, the generator is designed to provide lyrical snippets, verses, or conceptual ideas rather than full, coherent songs. It serves as a powerful brainstorming tool to help you overcome writer's block and get started."
    },
    {
      question: "Does it consider rhyme scheme or meter?",
      answer: "While the AI doesn't strictly adhere to complex rhyme schemes or meters (as human creativity is needed there), it is trained on vast amounts of text and can often generate lines that have a natural rhythm and occasional rhymes, especially with guidance in your prompt (e.g., 'lyrics that rhyme')."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the generated content original?",
      answer: "The AI creates unique combinations of words and phrases. While it draws on patterns learned from existing text, the output is original to the generation. However, it's always good practice to review and adapt the lyrics to truly make them your own."
