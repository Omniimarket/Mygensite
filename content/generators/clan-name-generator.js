      question: "What makes a good clan name?",
      answer: "A good clan name is memorable, unique, often aggressive or strategic, and reflects the clan's playstyle, values, or thematic elements. It should inspire loyalty among members and be recognizable to opponents."
    },
    {
      question: "Should my clan name be short or long?",
      answer: "Often, short, punchy names are more effective for clans, especially in fast-paced competitive games, as they are easier to remember and display. However, a longer, more descriptive name can also work if it's impactful."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I check if a clan name is available in my game?",
      answer: "You typically need to check within the game itself during clan creation or through its official forums/community tools. It's rare for external tools to have real-time access to in-game name databases."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the generator for non-gaming teams?",
      answer: "While primarily for gaming clans, the generator can certainly inspire names for other competitive or close-knit teams, such as sports clubs, e-sports teams, or even project groups, looking for a strong, unified identity."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the generated names are too generic?",
      answer: "Try adding more specific keywords related to your clan's unique characteristics, inside jokes, or the game's lore. Incorporating unique spelling or blending different words can also help create more distinctive names."
