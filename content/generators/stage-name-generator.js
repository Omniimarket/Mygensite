      question: "How detailed should my input be for better results?",
      answer: "The more descriptive your keywords or desired persona, the better the AI can understand your artistic vision. Include your genre, mood, personality traits, or any specific imagery you associate with your performance."
    },
    {
      question: "Can it suggest names for specific performance types (e.g., musician, magician, speaker)?",
      answer: "Yes! By including the performance type in your prompt (e.g., 'stage name for a blues singer', 'name for a corporate speaker', 'magician stage name'), the AI will try to align suggestions with that style."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I get names that are already taken?",
      answer: "The AI generates original combinations, but it doesn't check for existing names. Always perform your own research (e.g., on streaming platforms, social media, trademark databases) to ensure your chosen name is unique before finalizing it."
