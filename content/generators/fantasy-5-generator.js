      question: "How does the Fantasy 5 Number Generator select numbers?",
      answer: "Our generator uses a random number algorithm to select five unique numbers from a default range (commonly 1 to 36 or 1 to 42, representative of many Fantasy 5 games). Each time you generate, a new set of random numbers is provided."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the number range for my specific Fantasy 5 game?",
      answer: "Currently, the generator uses a common default range. It is essential that you, the user, verify the precise number pool for your specific state's Fantasy 5 game and ensure the generated numbers fall within that range. If your game has a different range, you may need to manually filter or re-generate."
    },
    {
      question: "Will using this generator improve my chances of winning Fantasy 5?",
      answer: "No, using a random number generator does not statistically improve your odds of winning the lottery. Each possible number combination has an equal probability of being drawn. The generator simply offers a convenient, unbiased way to choose your numbers."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this generator tailored for a specific state's Fantasy 5 game?",

    {
      question: "Does the generator save my generated numbers?",
      answer: "No, the generator does not store any of the numbers you produce. Each set is generated on demand, and once you navigate away from the page, the numbers are not retained. Therefore, it's important to note them down if you intend to use them."
