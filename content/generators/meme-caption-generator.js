    {
      question: "What's the difference between 'meme text' and 'meme caption'?",
      answer: "While often used interchangeably, 'meme text' typically refers to the words directly on the image itself, often in a specific font (like Impact). 'Meme caption' can refer to the text on the image, or the accompanying text you might write when sharing the meme on social media (e.g., 'Me trying to focus on work:'). This generator focuses on the text that goes *with* or *on* the image."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get captions for a specific meme template?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! If you have a particular meme template in mind (e.g., 'One Does Not Simply...', 'Is This a Pigeon?'), include its description or name in your prompt. The AI will then try to generate captions that fit that specific format's humor."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should a good meme caption be?",
      answer: "Generally, the shorter and punchier, the better. Most effective meme captions are one or two lines long, delivering the joke quickly without requiring too much reading. The goal is instant impact."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this tool suitable for generating captions for all types of humor?",
      answer: "Our AI is trained on a broad dataset of internet humor, so it can generate captions for various comedic styles, including observational, ironic, self-deprecating, and absurd humor. However, humor is subjective, so you may need to try different inputs to match your specific comedic taste."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the generated captions for social media posts?",
      answer: "Yes, the generated captions are perfect for pairing with your meme images when sharing them on platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit. They're designed to be concise and engaging for social media audiences."
