    <p>Using our Random Color Generator is simple and vibrant:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Generate Colors:</strong> Click the "Generate" button, and our tool will instantly produce a new, random color.</li>
      <li><strong>View Formats:</strong> The generated color will be displayed along with its common formats: Hex, RGB, and HSL, making it easy to use in different contexts.</li>
      <li><strong>Copy & Apply:</strong> Copy the desired color code format with a single click and apply it directly to your design or code.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate More:</strong> Keep clicking to explore an infinite spectrum of random hues!</li>
    </ol>

    {
      question: "What are Hex, RGB, and HSL color formats?",
      answer: "These are different ways to represent colors digitally. HEX (#RRGGBB) is common in web design. RGB (Red, Green, Blue) specifies intensity from 0-255 for each. HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) is often more intuitive for designers, allowing for easy adjustment of color, vibrancy, and brightness."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the generator ensure true randomness?",
      answer: "Our generator uses a high-quality random number generator to select values for the red, green, and blue components of the color. This ensures that every possible color in the RGB spectrum has an equal chance of being generated, resulting in genuine unpredictability."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate a palette of multiple random colors at once?",
      answer: "Currently, the generator focuses on producing one random color at a time to highlight its individual properties. However, you can generate multiple colors sequentially to build your own custom palette."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this tool suitable for generating accessible color combinations?",
      answer: "While it generates random colors, it doesn't automatically check for accessibility contrast ratios. If you're designing for accessibility, you'll need to use a separate contrast checker tool after generating colors."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I generate a color that is too light or too dark?",
      answer: "The generator produces colors across the full spectrum. If you need a specific brightness, you can use the HSL values provided and manually adjust the 'L' (Lightness) component in your design software or code, or simply re-generate until you find a suitable shade."
