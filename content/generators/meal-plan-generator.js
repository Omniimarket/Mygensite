    <h3>How Our Generator Crafts Your Custom Meal Plan</h3>
    <p>Using the **AI Meal Plan Generator** is efficient and highly personalized:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Define Your Needs:</strong> Enter your dietary preferences (e.g., "vegetarian", "keto", "pescatarian"), calorie goals (e.g., "1800 calories"), number of meals per day, or ingredients you want to include/exclude.</li>
      <li><strong>Specify Goal (Optional):</strong> Add preferences like "weight loss", "muscle gain", "energy boost", "beginner-friendly", or "family-friendly" to refine the plan's focus.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>The more specific and detailed your input, the more tailored and effective the generated meal plan will be for your lifestyle and goals.</p>

    <h3>Tips for Sticking to Your Meal Plan</h3>
    <p>Even with an AI-generated plan, consistency is key. Here's how to stay on track:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prep Ahead:</strong> Dedicate a few hours each week (e.g., Sunday) to meal prepping ingredients or full meals.</li>
      <li><strong>Grocery Shop Smart:</strong> Create your grocery list directly from your meal plan to avoid unnecessary purchases.</li>
      <li><strong>Be Flexible:</strong> Life happens! If you miss a meal or have an unexpected dinner out, don't abandon the whole plan. Just pick up where you left off.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Water intake is crucial for overall health and can sometimes be mistaken for hunger.</li>
      <li><strong>Track Progress:</strong> Monitor your energy levels, mood, and any physical changes to see how the plan is working for you.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't Deprive Yourself:</strong> Allow for occasional treats or 'free meals' if it helps you stick to the plan long-term without feeling deprived.</li>
    </ul>

      question: "Can it generate meal plans for specific diets (e.g., Keto, Vegan)?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! Include terms like 'keto', 'vegan', 'paleo', 'Mediterranean', 'low-carb', 'high-protein', or 'dairy-free' in your prompt."
    },
    {
      question: "Does it provide calorie counts or macros?",
      answer: "While it generates balanced meals, it may not provide exact calorie or macro breakdowns. You can specify calorie goals in your prompt, and the AI will try to adhere to them, but for precise tracking, you'll need to use a separate nutritional calculator."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate plans for different numbers of days?",
      answer: "Currently, it provides a sample plan. You can specify a duration (e.g., '3-day meal plan', 'weekly meal plan') in your prompt, but you might need to generate multiple times or extend the ideas yourself."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the generated meal plan suitable for medical conditions?",
      answer: "This generator provides general meal planning ideas for healthy individuals. It is NOT a substitute for professional medical or nutritional advice. If you have specific health conditions or dietary needs due to illness, please consult a registered dietitian or healthcare provider."
