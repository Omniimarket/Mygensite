      question: "What makes a good guild name?",
      answer: "A good guild name is memorable, unique, easy to pronounce, and reflects the guild's identity, playstyle, or thematic elements (e.g., heroic, dark, casual, competitive). It should resonate with members and stand out to others."
    },
    {
      question: "Should my guild name be short or long?",

    },
    {
      question: "How do I check if a guild name is available in my game?",

    {
      question: "What if the generated names aren't quite epic enough?",
