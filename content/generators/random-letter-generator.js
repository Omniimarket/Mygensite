    {
      question: "How does the generator ensure randomness?",
      answer: "Our generator uses a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG) to pick letters. This ensures that each letter has an equal chance of being selected, making the output truly unpredictable and suitable for most applications."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate specific types of letters (e.g., only vowels or consonants)?",
      answer: "Currently, the generator produces letters from the full English alphabet. If you need only vowels or consonants, you would need to manually filter the results or run the generator multiple times until you get the desired types."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a limit to how many letters I can generate?",
      answer: "While there might be a practical upper limit to prevent browser slowdowns, you can typically generate hundreds or even thousands of letters in a single request, depending on your needs."
    },
    {
      question: "Can these be used for creating unique identifiers?",
      answer: "Yes, combining random letters with numbers or other characters can be a component of creating unique identifiers or short codes, though for truly secure or globally unique IDs, more specialized tools might be needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Does it support non-English alphabets?",
      answer: "This specific generator is designed for the English alphabet (A-Z). For other alphabets, a different or more generalized character generator would be required."
    }
