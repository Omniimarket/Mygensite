      question: "What makes a good cocktail name?",
      answer: "A good cocktail name is memorable, unique, often evokes a sense of flavor, mood, or origin, and is easy to pronounce and remember. It should make people curious to try the drink."
    },
    {
      question: "Should the name reveal all the ingredients?",
      answer: "Not necessarily. A name can hint at key ingredients (e.g., 'Cucumber Cooler') but doesn't need to list everything. Often, a more evocative or mysterious name is preferred to spark curiosity, with the full ingredients listed on a menu."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate names for non-alcoholic drinks too?",
      answer: "Absolutely! The generator can be used for mocktails, infused waters, or custom sodas. Just describe the flavors, colors, or mood of your non-alcoholic beverage in the input."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the generated names are too generic?",
      answer: "Try adding more specific or unusual keywords related to your drink's unique qualities, a personal anecdote, or a more obscure ingredient. Combining different words in unexpected ways can also lead to more unique results."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I consider the glass or garnish when naming?",
      answer: "Yes, visual elements like the type of glass, the garnish, or the drink's color can be excellent sources of inspiration for a name. A name that complements the drink's appearance enhances the overall experience."
