      question: "What's the difference between a brand name and a business name?",
      answer: "A business name is the legal name of your entity. A brand name is how your products, services, or company are recognized by consumers. They can be the same, or a business might have multiple brand names under its umbrella."
    },
    {
      question: "Can this generator help with domain names too?",
      answer: "While it provides creative name ideas, you'll need to use a separate domain registrar's tool to check the real-time availability of domain names based on the generated suggestions. Prioritize '.com' if possible."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should a brand name be?",
      answer: "Generally, shorter names are more memorable and easier to pronounce. Aim for 2-4 syllables if possible, but impact and uniqueness are more important than strict length."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it important for a brand name to be unique?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Uniqueness is crucial for legal protection (trademark), avoiding customer confusion, and establishing a distinct market presence. Always conduct thorough availability checks."
