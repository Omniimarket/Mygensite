      question: "How do I choose the best name for my restaurant?",
      answer: "Consider your cuisine, target audience, desired ambiance, and the availability of the name (domain, social media, trademarks). A memorable, easy-to-pronounce name that hints at your restaurant's concept is usually best."
    },
    {
      question: "Should my restaurant name be descriptive or evocative?",
      answer: "It depends on your strategy. Descriptive names clearly state what you offer (e.g., 'Joe's Pizza'), while evocative names create a feeling or image (e.g., 'The Whispering Spoon'). Both can be effective if well-executed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate names for specific types of restaurants?",
      answer: "Yes, include your restaurant type (e.g., 'sushi bar', 'diner', 'fine dining', 'food truck') in your prompt to get more tailored suggestions."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes a restaurant name memorable?",
