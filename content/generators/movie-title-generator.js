    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate titles for specific movie genres (e.g., horror, comedy, action)?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! The more specific your input (e.g., 'title for a psychological horror film', 'action-comedy movie title', 'drama film title about family secrets'), the more tailored and relevant the suggestions will be."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should a good movie title be?",
      answer: "While there's no strict rule, many memorable movie titles are relatively short, often 1-3 words. Longer titles can work if they are particularly evocative or poetic, but generally, conciseness is key for impact and memorability."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a movie title and a working title?",
      answer: "A working title is a temporary title used during development and production. A movie title is the final, official name under which the film is released, chosen for its marketability and ability to represent the film's content."
    },
    {
      question: "Should a movie title give away the plot?",
      answer: "Generally, no. A good movie title should pique curiosity and hint at the genre or themes without revealing major spoilers or the entire plot. It's about drawing viewers in, not giving the story away."
