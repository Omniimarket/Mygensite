      question: "What makes a good villain name?",
      answer: "A good villain name is often intimidating, memorable, and reflects their powers, personality, or the nature of their evil. It can be evocative of darkness, chaos, decay, or immense power."
    },
    {
      question: "Should a villain name be descriptive or abstract?",
      answer: "Both approaches can be effective. Descriptive names (e.g., 'Doctor Doom', 'The Joker') immediately convey something about the character. Abstract names (e.g., 'Thanos', 'Lex Luthor') can build mystery and allow the character's actions to define the name."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I make sure the name sounds truly evil?",
      answer: "Consider using harsh sounds, words related to darkness, destruction, or fear (e.g., 'Grim', 'Void', 'Malice'). Combining Latin or ancient-sounding words can also add a sense of timeless evil."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate names for a group of villains or an evil organization?",
      answer: "Yes, you can input keywords related to the group's collective goals or themes (e.g., 'cult of chaos', 'shadow syndicate', 'apocalypse legion') to get relevant suggestions for villain teams or organizations."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the generated names are too generic?",
      answer: "Try adding more specific details about your villain's unique traits or a specific aspect of their evil. Experiment with combining different words or adding unique prefixes/suffixes for more distinctive results."
