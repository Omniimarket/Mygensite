    },
    {
      question: "Can I generate names for specific electronic music genres?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely! The more specific your input (e.g., 'DJ name for deep house', 'techno producer name', 'EDM artist moniker'), the more tailored and relevant the suggestions will be."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I check if a DJ name is available?",
      answer: "You'll need to manually check for availability across major music platforms (SoundCloud, Mixcloud, Spotify), social media (Instagram, Twitter), and domain registrars to ensure uniqueness and brand consistency."
    },
    {
      question: "Should a DJ name be short or complex?",
      answer: "Generally, shorter and punchier names are more memorable and easier to brand. However, a complex or multi-word name can work if it's particularly evocative and relevant to your artistic vision, as long as it's still pronounceable."
